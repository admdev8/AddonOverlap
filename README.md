# AddonOverlap
An Attempt to document the prevention techniques of advertisment, tracking, and security add-ons

We have a lot of add-ons that help us protect our privacy, improve security, and block ads.  Those of us interested in these techniques can have trouble making recommendations or telling where the overlap may lay.
This project tries to classify some of the various features of many popular add-ons to let you know if you might have overlap in features.
